     ##  DSNR: Deep Semantic Network Representation
This a Tensorflow implementation of the DSNR algorithm, which learns a low-dimensional representations for each node in a network. DSNR explores the implicit semantic information of nodes and captures the high-order semantic proximity. Specifically, to make the model effective, DSNR consist of three module, i.e., semantic aware module which models the implicit semantic information of nodes and gets the enhanced semantic feature representation by a deep autoencoder, embedding module which fuses the enhanced semantic feature in node identity sequence generated by the truncated random walk to generate node semantic sequence, and high-order structure aware module which translate the network from the node semantic sequence to the node identity sequence by the attention-enhanced seq2seq framework.

    ## Requirement:
	
    python 3.6.4
    Tensorflow 1.0
    Numpy
    networkx
    Sklearn
    The develop tool is PyCharm Community Edition 2019.3.1
    ##  Dataset:
    Cora, Citeseer and Wiki datasets are given.
    ## including:
.edgelist
.features (node original semantic feature vector representations: attributes of nodes have been processed as TFIDF vector)
.svd (node original semantic feature vector representations: TFIDF matrix on node attributes is decomposed by SVD, and then the left singular matrix obtained is taken as the input feature)
In this paper, we select node TFIDF feature vector
